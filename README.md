# Workshop Testing in Angular
This is a little Example webshop that allows you to add products to a basket and purchase the items you have in your basket.

Requirements:
- `node` >= 6.9 (use `nvm` for easier management of your `node` and `npm` version)
- `npm` >= 3 or `yarn` >= 0.21
- Chrome installed (for running tests)

## Downloading the required tools
We strongly suggest you use `yarn` for running the initial install as it will be faster and use your internet connection more efficient.

Once you've installed the requirements mentioned above you can simply run the following command from the same folder as this README 

```
yarn
```
or (if you prefer `npm` over `yarn`)

```
npm install
```

After both tools complete their download you're ready to start the application or the tests 

## Run the app
Run the following command (from the same folder as this README)
``` 
npm run all
```
Now open the app in a browser on http://localhost:4200

## Running the tests
The Tests will be run using the `karma.conf.js` file generated by the angular-cli. Simply run the following command from the same folder as this README.

```
yarn test
```
or if you prefer `npm` use:
```
npm test
```
